 *   You are to write a RARS translation of this C program.  Because
 *   this is the first assembly language program you are writing where you
 *   must deal with register conflicts and manage the stack, there are
 *   a lot of hints given in C comments about how to do the translation.
 *   In future lab exercises and on midterms, you will be expected
 *   to do this kind of translation without being given very many hints!
